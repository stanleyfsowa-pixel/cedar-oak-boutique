# Logo Integration Instructions

Since I cannot directly access the Instagram logo, here are step-by-step instructions to get the logo and integrate it into your website.

## Step 1: Download the Logo

### Method 1: Right-click Save (Easiest)
1. Go to https://www.instagram.com/cedarandoakboutique/
2. Right-click on the profile picture/logo
3. Select "Save image as..." or "Copy image"
4. Save as `logo.png` or `logo.jpg` in the `images/` folder

### Method 2: Instagram Profile Picture Downloader
1. Use a service like https://instadp.com/
2. Enter the Instagram username: `cedarandoakboutique`
3. Download the full-size profile picture
4. Save to `images/logo.png`

### Method 3: Screenshot and Crop
1. Take a screenshot of the Instagram profile
2. Crop just the logo/profile picture
3. Save as `images/logo.png`

## Step 2: Optimize the Logo
- Recommended size: 300x300px minimum
- Format: PNG (for transparency) or JPG
- Keep it under 100KB for fast loading

## Step 3: I'll Update the Code

Once you have the logo file, let me know and I'll update the website to:
1. Replace the text logo with the actual image
2. Update the hero section to feature the logo prominently
3. Adjust the navigation to include the logo
4. Ensure it looks great on all devices

Would you like me to proceed with updating the code assuming you'll add the logo file, or would you prefer to get the logo first and then I'll make the changes?
